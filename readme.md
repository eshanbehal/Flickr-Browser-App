               HEYS GUYS JUST STARTED WITH CREATING A NEW APP #FLICKR BROWSER.....

1.Just starting off a new project flickr browser that will allow us to search for 
  different types of photos from the flickr.

2. For those who dont know whats flickr - Its an image sharing website.

   so my app will allow users to search through flickr using sepperate tags and then
   show the results on the screen.

3. Will be using API from the flickr and download some of the images to my application.

   for more info : https://www.flickr.com/
                   
                 : https://www.flickr.com/services/api/

4. Added some Log codes for the app in order to view the process of debugging in the logcat.
