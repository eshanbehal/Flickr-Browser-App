               HEYS GUYS JUST STARTED WITH CREATING A NEW APP #FLICKR BROWSER.....

1.Just starting off a new project flickr browser that will allow us to search for 
  different types of photos from the flickr.

2. For those who dont know whats flickr - Its an image sharing website.

   so my app will allow users to search through flickr using sepperate tags and then
   show the results on the screen.

3. Will be using API from the flickr and download some of the images to my application.

   for more info : https://www.flickr.com/
                   
                 : https://www.flickr.com/services/api/

4. Added some Log codes for the app in order to view the process of debugging in the logcat.

5. now after entering the log codes firstly i will be downloading data ie raw data from the 
   internet and add it using Async task method by creating different java class.

   under this java class i have enterend code for the handeling of the url data for us.
   nd here created the http connection and entered the code for the various exception that
   can occur while downloading data in the seperate thread.

   ==============

1. jst starting off today with writing the code for the calling of the getrawdata class
   in the main activity class just by creating mcallback method and it will do all the work.

2. ended todays code by making new java classes for downloading the data from the async task
   method and then creating other classes one for the photos for adding various fields to the
   photo class like title , author , author_id.
   \and the getflickrjson data class for parsing the data downloading in this this class and 
    to be called later in the main activity class...




     20th june
  ===============

1.Starting off today by adding some info regarding my project....

2. In my app i have basically used the concept of notifying the calling class that the data has been
   downloaded and made avialabke to it.

3. so here the basic concept that i have used is that calling class uses the getrawdata to download the 
   data from the url and getrawdata then does the downloading and when its finished it calls the class
   back using the callback method.

4. ending today with setting up the layout interface of my app by using various widgets like cardview,
   scrollbar view , textview , imageview etc.

5. forgot to add also used the concept of the nesting linear layouts with the Photo detail ativity.
   and also added various features to the widgets by changing their attributes like layout weight etc.



    21st june
  =============

1. starting off today by writing the code for the recycler view adapter and creating other java aclasses
   needed.

2. just added code for the layout design for my app.
